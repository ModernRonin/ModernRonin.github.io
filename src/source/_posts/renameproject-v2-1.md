`renameproject` now also supports moving projects to different directories. See [here](https://github.com/ModernRonin/ProjectRenamer#release-history) for details, or just update it with

```sh
dotnet tool update --global ModernRonin.ProjectRenamer
```

and call it without arguments from your solution directory to see its help.
