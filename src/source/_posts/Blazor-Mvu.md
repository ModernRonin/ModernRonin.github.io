Over my Christmas vacation I've written a small framework enabling MVU on Blazor with C#, `Blazor.Mvu`. Now this weekend I've finally gotten round to put this online with some documentation.

I don't consider the framework finished, let alone production-ready. I'm using it in a hobby project and only once that hobby-project is completed, I'll consider Blazor.Mvu production-ready.

However, I would be very interested to get feedback and, ideally, find collaborators. This kind of framework will only ever get really good if it's used by many different people with different situations and needs, and it also needs more than just one guy developing it, solely to prevent tunnel-vision :-)

If this looks interesting to you, check out the detailed description it its [repo](https://github.com/ModernRonin/Blazor.Mvu).
