There's another update out for `renameproject`, a bugfix release.

This one enables it to run on linux and other *nix platforms.

 See [here](https://github.com/ModernRonin/ProjectRenamer#release-history) for details, or just update it with

```sh
dotnet tool update --global ModernRonin.ProjectRenamer
```
