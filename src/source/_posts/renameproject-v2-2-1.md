There's another update out for `renameproject`. 

This one adds support for `<Import Project="...">` directives in the project files.

See [here](https://github.com/ModernRonin/ProjectRenamer#release-history) for details, or just update it with

```sh
dotnet tool update --global ModernRonin.ProjectRenamer
```
