If anyone wondered, like me, how in Visual Studio you can get a horizontal equivalent for `Window | Split`:

While the focus is on the tab you want to duplicate, click `Window | New Window`, and then you get basically a copied tab. 

In my not so humble opinion, this is a bit of a misnomer, they should have called that menu entry "Clone tab" (and put it into the context menu of the tab, too).
